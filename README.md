# [ UNDER CONSTRUCTION ]

The project source code is in the folder *./ostrich_proj/lib*

We structurally define the most commonly used OutSystems templates in *./ostrich_proj/test/benchmark.ml*, using the syntax defined in the source code. We test the typing and evaluation of these template definitions. Our syntax allows the instantiation of templates inside the definition of other templates.

To execute this project, install **dune**.
